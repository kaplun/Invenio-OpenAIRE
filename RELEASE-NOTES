CDS Invenio v0.99.2 was released on October 20, 2010.

This is a bugfix release only.  It is recommended to all CDS Invenio
sites using v0.99.1 or previous releases.

What's new:

    view a restricted record, users are now required to have
    authorizations to access all restricted collections the given
    record may belong to (WebSearch)

 *) strict checking of user query history when setting up email
    notification alert, preventing URL mangling attempts (WebAlert)

 *) fixed possible Unix signal conflicts for tasks performing I/O
    operations or running external processes, relevant notably to
    full-text indexing of remote files (BibSched)

 *) fixed full-text indexing and improved handling of files of
    `unexpected' extensions (BibIndex, WebSubmit)

 *) streaming of files of `unknown' MIME type now defaults to
    application/octet-stream (WebSubmit)

 *) fixed addition of new MARC fields in the record editor (BibEdit)

 *) fixed issues in full-text file attachment via MARC (BibUpload)

 *) fixed authaction CLI client (WebAccess)

 *) ... plus other minor fixes and improvements
