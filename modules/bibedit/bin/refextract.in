"""
   "refextract" is used to extract and process the "references"
   or "citations" made to other documents from within a document.
   A document's "references" section is usually found at the end of
   the document, and generally consists of a list of the works
   cited during the course of the document.
   "bibrefextract" can attempt to identify a document's references
   section and extract it from the document.  It can also attempt
   to standardise the references (correct the names of journals
   etc so that they are written in a standard format), and mark them
   up so that they can be linked to the full articles on the Web by
   means of hyper-links.

   "bibrefextract" has 4 phases of processing (passes):
    1. Convert PDF file to plaintext (UTF-8).
    2. Extract References from plaintext.
    3. Recognise and standardise citations in the extracted
       reference lines. (Periodical titles and institutional
       report numbers are standardised with the aid of
       dedicated knowledge-bases.)
    4. Markup standardised citations in MARC XML and output
       them.

   Options:
      --help, -h                Display help/usage message and exit.
      --version, -V             Print version number and exit.
      --output-raw-refs, -r     output raw references, as extracted
                                from the document.
