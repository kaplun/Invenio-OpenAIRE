<a name="1"></a><h2>1. Overview</h2>

<p>BibUpload enables you to upload bibliographic data in MARCXML
format into Invenio bibliographic database.  It is also used
internally by other Invenio modules as the sole entrance of
metadata into the bibliographic databases.</p>

<p>Note that before uploading a MARCXML file, you may want to run
provided <code>/opt/invenio/bin/xmlmarclint</code> on it in order
to verify its correctness.</p>

<a name="2"></a><h2>2. Configuring BibUpload</h2>

<p>BibUpload takes a MARCXML file as its input.  There is nothing to
be configured for these files.  If the files have to be coverted into
MARCXML from some other format, structured or not, this is usually
done beforehand via <a href="bibconvert-admin">BibConvert</a> module.
</p>

<p>Note that if you are using external system numbers for your
records, such as when your records are being synchronized from an
external system, then BibUpload knows about the tag 970 as the one
containing external system number.  (To change this 970 tag into
something else, you would have to edit BibUpload config source file.)
</p>

<p>Note also that in the similar way BibUpload knows about OAI
identifiers, so that it will refuse to insert the same OAI harvested
record twice, for example.
</p>

<a name="3"></a><h2>3. Running BibUpload</h2>

<a name="3.1"></a><h3>3.1 Inserting new records</h3>

<p>Consider that you have an MARCXML file containing new records that
is to be uploaded into the Invenio.  (For example, it might have
been produced by <a href="bibconvert-admin">BibConvert</a>.)  To finish
the upload, you would call the BibUpload script in the insert mode as
follows:

<blockquote>
<pre>
$ bibupload -i file.xml
<pre>
</blockquote>

In the insert mode, all the records from the file will be treated as
new.  This means that they should not contain neither 001 tags
(holding record IDs) nor 970 tags (holding external system numbers).
BibUpload would refuse to upload records having these tags, in order
to prevent potential double uploading.  If your file does contain 001
or 970, then chances are that you want to update existing records, not
re-upload them as new, and so BibUpload will warn you about this and
will refuse to continue.
</p>

<p>For example, to insert a new record, your file should look like this:

<pre>
    &lt;record&gt;
        &lt;datafield tag="100" ind1=" " ind2=" "&gt;
            &lt;subfield code="a"&gt;Doe, John&lt;/subfield&gt;
        &lt;/datafield&gt;
        &lt;datafield tag="245" ind1=" " ind2=" "&gt;
            &lt;subfield code="a"&gt;On The Foo And Bar&lt;/subfield&gt;
        &lt;/datafield&gt;
    &lt;/record&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<a name="3.2"></a><h3>3.2 Updating existing records</h3>

<p>When you want to update existing records, with the new content from
your input MARCXML file, then your input file should contain either
tags 001 (holding record IDs) or tag 970 (holding external system
numbers).  BibUpload will try to match existing records via 001 and
970 and if it finds a record in the database that corresponds to a
record from the file, it will update its content.  Otherwise it will
signal an error saying that it could not find the
record-to-be-updated.
</p>

<p>For example, to update a title of record #123 via correct mode, your
input file should contain record ID in the 001 tag and the title in
245 tag as follows:

<pre>
    &lt;record&gt;
        &lt;controlfield tag="001"&gt;123&lt;/controlfield&gt;
        &lt;datafield tag="245" ind1=" " ind2=" "&gt;
            &lt;subfield code="a"&gt;My Newly Updated Title&lt;/subfield&gt;
        &lt;/datafield&gt;
    &lt;/record&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<p>There are several updating modes:
<pre>

    -r, --replace Replace existing records by those from the XML
                  MARC file.  The original content is wiped out
                  and fully replaced.  Signals error if record
                  is not found via matching record IDs or system
                  numbers.

                  Note also that `-r' can be combined with `-i'
                  into an `-ir' option that would automatically
                  either insert records as new if they are not
                  found in the system, or correct existing
                  records if they are found to exist.

    -a, --append  Append fields from XML MARC file at the end of
                  existing records.  The original content is
                  enriched only.  Signals error if record is not
                  found via matching record IDs or system
                  numbers.

    -c, --correct Correct fields of existing records by those
                  from XML MARC file.  The original record
                  content is modified only on those fields from
                  the XML MARC file where both the tags and the
                  indicators match: the original fields are
                  removed and replaced by those from the XML
                  MARC file.  Fields not present in XML MARC
                  file are not changed (unlike the -r option).
                  Signals error if record is not found via
                  matching record IDs or system numbers.

    -d, --delete  Delete fields of existing records that are
                  contained in the XML MARC file. The fields in
                  the original record that are not present in
                  the XML MARC file are preserved.
                  This is incompatible with FFT (see below).
</pre>
</p>

<p>If you combine the <code>--pretend</code> parameter with the above updating modes you can actually test what would be executed without modifying the database or altering the system status.</p>

<a name="3.3"></a><h3>3.3 Inserting and updating at the same time</h3>

<p>Note that the insert/update modes can be combined together.  For
example, if you have a file that contains a mixture of new records
with possibly some records to be updated, then you can run:

<blockquote>
<pre>
$ bibupload -i -r file.xml
<pre>
</blockquote>

In this case BibUpload will try to do an update (for records having
either 001 or 970 identifiers), or an insert (for the other ones).
</p>

<a name="3.4"></a><h3>3.4 Updating preformatted output formats</h3>

<p>BibFormat can use this special upload mode during which metadata will
not be updated, only the preformatted output formats for records:

<pre>
    -f, --format        Upload only the format (FMT) fields.
                        The original content is not changed, and neither its modification date.
</pre>

This is useful for <code>bibreformat</code> daemon only; human
administrators don't need to explicitly know about this mode.
</p>

<a name="3.5"></a><h3>3.5 Uploading fulltext files</h3>

<p>The fulltext files can be uploaded and revised via a special FFT
("fulltext file transfer") tag with the following
semantic:

<pre>
    FFT $a  ...  location of the docfile to upload (a filesystem path or a URL)
        $n  ...  docfile name (optional; if not set, deduced from $a)
        $m  ...  new desired docfile name (optional; used for renaming files)
        $t  ...  docfile type (e.g. Main, Additional)
        $d  ...  docfile description (optional)
        $f  ...  format (optional; if not set, deduced from $a)
        $z  ...  comment (optional)
        $r  ...  restriction (optional, see below)
        $v  ...  version (used only with REVERT and DELETE-FILE, see below)
        $x  ...  url/path for an icon (optional)
</pre>
</p>

<p>For example, to upload a new fulltext file <code>thesis.pdf</code>
associated to record ID 123:

<pre>
    &lt;record&gt;
        &lt;controlfield tag="001"&gt;123&lt;/controlfield&gt;
        &lt;datafield tag="FFT" ind1=" " ind2=" "&gt;
            &lt;subfield code="a"&gt;/tmp/thesis.pdf&lt;/subfield&gt;
            &lt;subfield code="t"&gt;Main&lt;/subfield&gt;
            &lt;subfield code="d"&gt;
              This is the fulltext version of my thesis in the PDF format.
              Chapter 5 still needs some revision.
            &lt;/subfield&gt;
        &lt;/datafield&gt;
    &lt;/record&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<p>The FFT tag can be repetitive, so one can pass along another FFT
tag instance containing a pointer to e.g. the thesis defence slides.
The subfields of an FFT tag are non-repetitive.
</p>

<p>When more than one FFT tag is specified for the same document
(e.g. for adding more than one format at a time), if $t (docfile
type), $m (new desired docfile name), $r (restriction), $v (version),
$x (url/path for an icon), are specified, they should be identically
specified for each single entry of FFT.  E.g. if you want to specify
an icon for a document with two formats (say .pdf and .doc), you'll
write two FFT tags, both containing the same $x subfield.</p>

<p>The bibupload process, when it encounters FFT tags, will
automatically populate fulltext storage space
(<code>/opt/invenio/var/data/files</code>) and metadata record
associated tables (<code>bibrec_bibdoc</code>, <code>bibdoc</code>) as
appropriate.  It will also enrich the 856 tags (URL tags) of the MARC
metadata of the record in question with references to the latest
versions of each file.
</p>

<p>Note that for $a and $x subfields filesystem paths must be absolute
(e.g. <code>/tmp/icon.gif</code> is valid,
while <code>Destkop/icon.gif</code> is not) and they must be readable
by the user/group of the bibupload process that will handle the FFT.
</p>

<p>The bibupload process supports the usual modes correct, append,
replace, insert with a semantic that is somewhat similar to the
semantic of the metadata upload:

<blockquote>
<table border="1">
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th><th>Metadata</th>  <th>Fulltext</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>objects being uploaded</td><td> MARC field instances characterized by tags (010-999) </td> <td>  fulltext files characterized by unique file names (FFT $n)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>   insert  </td><td>     insert new record; must not exist     </td><td>          insert new files; must not exist </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>   append  </td><td>     append new tag instances for the given tag XXX, regardless of existing tag instances</td><td>          append new files, if filename (i.e. new format) not already present </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>   correct  </td><td>    correct tag instances for the given tag XXX; delete existing ones and replace with given ones    </td><td>     correct files with the given filename; add new revision or delete file; if the docname does not exist the file is added</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>   replace   </td><td>   replace all tags, whatever XXX are</td><td> replace all files, whatever filenames are </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>   delete    </td><td>   delete all existing tag instances</td><td> not supported </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>Note, in append and insert mode, <pre>$m</pre> is ignored.

<p>In order to rename a document just use the the correct mode specifing in the
$n subfield the original docname that should be renamed and in $m the new name.
</p>

<p>Special values can be assigned to the $t subfield.</p>

<table border="1">
<thead><tr><th>Value</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><tt>PURGE</tt></td><td>In order to purge previous file revisions (i.e. in order to keep only the latest file version), please use the correct mode with $n docname and $t PURGE as the special keyword.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>DELETE</tt></td><td>In order to delete all existing versions of a file, making it effectively hidden, please use the correct mode with $n docname
and $t DELETE as the special keyword.</td></tr>
<tr><td>EXPUNGE</td><td>In order to expunge (i.e. remove completely, also from the
filesystem) all existing versions of a file, making it effectively disappear, please use the correct mode with $n docname and $t EXPUNGE as the special keyword.
</td><tr>
<tr><td><tt>FIX-MARC</tt></td><td>In order to synchronize MARC to the bibrec/bibdoc structure (e.g. after an update or a tweak in the database), please use the correct mode with $n docname and $t FIX-MARC as the special keyword.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>FIX-ALL</tt></td><td>In order to fix a record (i.e. put all its linked documents in a coherent state) and synchronize the MARC to the table, please use the correct mode with $n docname and $t FIX-ALL as the special keyword.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>REVERT</tt></td><td>In order to revert to a previous file revision (i.e. to create a new revision with the same content as some previous revision had), please use the correct mode with $n docname, $t REVERT as the special
keyword and $v the number corresponding to the desired version.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>DELETE-FILE</tt></td><td>In order to delete a particular file added by mistake, please use the correct mode with $n docname, $t DELETE-FILE, specifing $v version and $f format. Note that this operation is not reversible. Note that
if you don't spcify a version, the last version will be used.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>In order to preserve previous comments and descriptions when
correcting, please use the KEEP-OLD-VALUE special keyword with the
desired $d and $z subfield.
</p>

<p>The $r subfield can contain a string that can be use to restrict
the given document. The same value must be specified for all the
format of a given document. By default the keyword will be used as the status
parameter for the "viewrestrdoc" action, which can be used to give
access right/restriction to desired user. e.g. if you set the keyword
"thesis", you can the connect the "thesisviewer" to the action
"viewrestrdoc" with parameter "status" set to "thesis". Then all the
user which are linked with the "thesisviewer" role will be able to
download the document. Instead any other user will not be
allowed. Note, if you use the keyword "KEEP-OLD-VALUE" the previous
restrictions if applicable will be kept.
</p>

<p>More advanced document-level restriction is indeed possible. If the value
contains infact:
<ul>
<li><tt><strong>email: </strong>john.doe@example.org</tt>: then only the user
having <tt>john.doe@example.org</tt> as email address will be authorized to
access the given document.</li>
<li><tt><strong>group: </strong>example</tt>: then only users belonging to
the local/external group <tt>example</tt> will be authorized to
access the given document.</li>
<li><tt><strong>role: </strong>example</tt>: then only the users
belonging to the WebAccess role <tt>example</tt> will be authorized to
access the given document.</li>
<li><tt><strong>firerole: </strong>allow .../deny...</tt>: then only the users
implicitly matched by the given
<a href="/help/admin/webaccess-admin-guide#6">firewall like role definition</a>
will be authorized to access the given document.</li>
<li><tt><strong>status: </strong>example</tt>: then only the users
belonging to roles having an authorization for the WebAccess action
<tt>viewrestrdoc</tt> with parameter <tt>status</tt> set to <tt>example</tt>
will be authorized (that is exactly like setting $r to <tt>example</tt>).</li>
</ul>
Note, that authors (as defined in the record MARC) and superadmin are always
authorized to access a document, no matter what is the given value of the status.
</p>

<p>Note that each time bibupload is called on a record, the 8564 tags
pointing to locally stored files are recreated on the basis of the
full-text files connected to the record.  Thus, if you whish to update
some 8564 tag pointing to a locally managed file, the only way to
perform this is through the FFT tag, not by editing 8564 directly.<p>

<a name="4"></a><h2>4. Batch Uploader</h2>
<a name="4.1"></a><h3>4.1 Web interface - Cataloguers</h3>
<p>The batchuploader web interface can be used either to upload metadata files or documents. Opposed to daemon mode, actions will be executed only once.</p>

<p>The available upload history displays metadata and document uploads using the web interface, not daemon mode.</p>

<a name="4.2"></a><h3>4.2 Web interface - Robots</h3>
<p>If it is needed to use the batch upload function from within command line, this can be achieved with a curl call, like:
<blockquote>
<pre>
$ curl -F 'file=@localfile.xml' -F 'mode=-i' http://cdsweb.cern.ch/batchuploader/robotupload -A invenio_webupload
<pre>
</blockquote></p>

<p>This service provides (client, file) checking to assure the records are put into a collection the client has rights to.<br />
To configure this permissions, check <tt>CFG_BATCHUPLOADER_WEB_ROBOT_RIGHTS</tt> variable in the configuration file.<br />
The allowed user agents can also be defined using the <tt>CFG_BATCHUPLOADER_WEB_ROBOT_AGENT</tt> variable.</p>

<a name="4.3"></a><h3>4.2 Daemon mode</h3>

<p>The batchuploader daemon mode is intended to be a bibsched task for document or metadata upload. The parent directory where the daemon will look for folders <tt>metadata</tt> and <tt>documents</tt> must be specified in the invenio configuration file.</p>
<p>An example of how directories should be arranged, considering that invenio was installed in folder <tt>/opt/invenio</tt> would be:
<pre>
     /opt/invenio/var/batchupload
            /opt/invenio/var/batchupload/documents
                    /opt/invenio/var/batchupload/documents/append
                    /opt/invenio/var/batchupload/documents/revise
            /opt/invenio/var/batchupload/metadata
                    /opt/invenio/var/batchupload/metadata/append
                    /opt/invenio/var/batchupload/metadata/correct
                    /opt/invenio/var/batchupload/metadata/insert
                    /opt/invenio/var/batchupload/metadata/replace
</pre>
</p>
<p>When running the batchuploader daemon there are two possible execution modes:

<pre>
        -m,   --metadata    Look for metadata files in folders insert, append, correct and replace.
                            All files are uploaded and then moved to the corresponding DONE folder.
        -d,   --documents   Look for documents in folders append and revise. Uploaded files are then
                            moved to DONE folders if possible.
</pre>
By default, metadata mode is used.</p>

<p>An example of invocation would be:
<blockquote>
<pre>
$ batchuploader --documents
<pre>
</blockquote></p>

It is possible to program batch uploader to run periodically. Read the <a href='howto-run'>Howto-run guide</a> to see how.
