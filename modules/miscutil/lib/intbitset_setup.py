    description = """
    Defines an intbitset data object to hold unordered sets of
    unsigned integers with ultra fast set operations, implemented via
    bit vectors and Python C extension to optimize speed and memory
    usage.

    Emulates the Python built-in set class interface with some
    additional specific methods such as its own fast dump and load
    marshalling functions.  Uses real bits to optimize memory usage,
    so may have issues with endianness if you transport serialized
    bitsets between various machine architectures.
