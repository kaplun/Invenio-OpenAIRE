"""WebSubmit function - Archives files uploaded with the upload file
                        interface.

To be used on par with Create_Upload_Files_Interface.py function:
 - Create_Upload_Files_Interface records the actions performed by user.
 - Move_Uploaded_Files_to_Storage executes the recorded actions.

NOTE:
=====

 - Due to the way WebSubmit works, this function can only work when
   positionned at step 2 in WebSubmit admin, and
   Create_Upload_Files_Interface is at step 1

    The function moves files uploaded using the
    Create_Upload_Files_Interface.py function.

    It reads the action previously performed by the user on the files
    and calls the corresponding functions of bibdocfile.

    @param parameters:(dictionary) - must contain:
      + iconsizes: sizes of the icons to create (when applicable),
                   separated by commas. Eg: 180>,700>

      + createIconDoctypes: the list of doctypes for which an icon
                            should be created.
                            Eg:
